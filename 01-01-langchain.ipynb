After three years as a software engineer, since he graduated in Computer Science (2003) he has been working at UPM in the Ontology Engineering Group in several European and Spanish research projects. His research focuses on the ontological engineering, semantic interoperability, and ontology-based data and application integration. In 2008 he obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the UPM with his thesis titled “Benchmarking Semantic Web technology”, which obtained the Ph.D. Extraordinary Award at UPM. He regularly participates in standardization bodies (W3C, OASIS, AENOR) and in the program committees of the conferences and workshops that are most relevant in the field and has organised several international conferences and workshops.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calcium_hydroxide,Calcium hydroxide,"Calcium hydroxide (traditionally called slaked lime) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(OH)2. It is a colorless crystal or white powder and is produced when quicklime (calcium oxide) is mixed or slaked with water. It has many names including hydrated lime, caustic lime, builders' lime, slaked lime, cal, and pickling lime. Calcium hydroxide is used in many applications, including food preparation, where it has been identified as E number E526. Limewater, also called milk of lime, is the common name for a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canite,Canite,"Canite (also known as caneboard, pinboard, softboard) is a low density fibreboard panel made from sugar cane fibres. It is easy to handle, light weight and durable. Due to its low environmental footprint it is considered a sustainable building product. It may be used without finish, painted or rendered with natural lime-based products. It is commonly used for 
* Interior wall and ceiling lining 
* Pin boards, bulletin board 
* Office partitions 
* Protective covering boards 
* Sound isolation and reflected sound reduction 
* Door fillings 
* Stucco background 
* Soundproofing under floorboards 
* Fire lighter (saturated with paraffin) In Australia, canite is commonly sold in 2400 x 1200 mm panels. Typical thickness is 10–13 mm. Typical density is 350 kg/m3."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beaverboard,Beaverboard,"Beaverboard (also beaver board) is a fiberboard building material, formed of wood fibre compressed into sheets. It was originally a trademark. It has occasionally been used as a canvas by artists. The painting American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood was painted on a beaverboard panel."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Energetically_modified_cement,Energetically modified cement,"Energetically modified cements (EMCs) are a class of cements made from pozzolans (e.g. fly ash, volcanic ash, pozzolana), silica sand, blast furnace slag, or Portland cement (or blends of these ingredients). The term ""energetically modified"" arises by virtue of the mechanochemistry process applied to the raw material, more accurately classified as ""high energy ball milling"" (HEBM). This causes, amongst others, a thermodynamic transformation in the material to increase its chemical reactivity. For EMCs, the HEBM process used is a unique form of specialised vibratory milling discovered in Sweden and applied only to cementitious materials, here called ""EMC Activation"". By improving the reactivity of pozzolans, their strength-development rate is increased. This allows for compliance with modern product-performance requirements (""technical standards"") for concretes and mortars. In turn, this allows for the replacement of Portland cement in the concrete and mortar mixes. This has a number of benefits to their long-term qualities. Energetically modified cements have a wide range of uses. For example, EMCs have been used in concretes for large infrastructure projects in the United States, meeting U.S. concrete standards."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Engineered_cementitious_composite,Engineered cementitious composite,"Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC), also called Strain Hardening Cement-based Composites (SHCC) or more popularly as bendable concrete, is an easily molded mortar-based composite reinforced with specially selected short random fibers, usually polymer fibers. Unlike regular concrete, ECC has a tensile strain capacity in the range of 3–7%, compared to 0.01% for ordinary portland cement (OPC) paste, mortar or concrete. ECC therefore acts more like a ductile metal material rather than a brittle glass material (as does OPC concrete), leading to a wide variety of applications."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Engineered_wood,Engineered wood,"Engineered wood, also called mass timber, composite wood, man-made wood, or manufactured board, includes a range of derivative wood products which are manufactured by binding or fixing the strands, particles, fibres, or veneers or boards of wood, together with adhesives, or other methods of fixation to form composite material. The panels vary in size but can range upwards of 64 by 8 feet (19.5 by 2.4 m) and in the case of cross-laminated timber (CLT) can be of any thickness from a few inches to 16 inches (410 mm) or more. These products are engineered to precise design specifications, which are tested to meet national or international standards and provide uniformity and predictability in their structural performance. Engineered wood products are used in a variety of applications, from home construction to commercial buildings to industrial products. The products can be used for joists and beams that replace steel in many building projects. The term mass timber describes a group of building materials that can replace concrete assemblies. Broad-base adoption of mass timber and their substitution for steel and concrete in new mid-rise construction projects over the coming decades could help mitigate climate change. Typically, engineered wood products are made from the same hardwoods and softwoods used to manufacture lumber. Sawmill scraps and other wood waste can be used for engineered wood composed of wood particles or fibers, but whole logs are usually used for veneers, such as plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or particle board. Some engineered wood products, like oriented strand board (OSB), can use trees from the poplar family, a common but non-structural species. Alternatively, it is also possible to manufacture similar engineered bamboo from bamboo; and similar engineered cellulosic products from other lignin-containing materials such as rye straw, wheat straw, rice straw, hemp stalks, kenaf stalks, or sugar cane residue, in which case they contain no actual wood but rather vegetable fibers. Flat-pack furniture is typically made out of man-made wood due to its low manufacturing costs and its low weight."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enviroboard,Enviroboard,"Enviroboard is a paper-like or cardboard-like construction and packaging material, generally manufactured using compressed, ecologically safe, agricultural material. Most often this means employing the use of high-cellulose waste fibres, such as the post-harvest straw of rice, barley, wheat, and elephant grass or alternatively, a more urban waste stream such as newspaper fibre. Construction panels built from agricultural wastes have been around for hundreds of years, especially in Central and Eastern Europe where pressed leaves and straw were used as insulation and even structural material. Environmental board panels should not be confused with straw bale construction which does not process waste fibres into a compressed standardized board panel. The concept of environmental construction panels dovetails with the principles of sustainability, namely reducing the impact that the entire life-cycle of constructing built environments has on the environment. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Enviroboard on 29 August 2016."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_building_materials,List of building materials,"This is a list of building materials. Many types of building materials are used in the construction industry to create buildings and structures. These categories of materials and products are used by architects and construction project managers to specify the materials and methods used for building projects. Some building materials like cold rolled steel framing are considered modern methods of construction, over the traditionally slower methods like blockwork and timber. Many building materials have a variety of uses, therefore it is always a good idea to consult the manufacturer to check if a product is best suited to your requirements."

This expansion makes it useful as a specialty packing material which forms to the shape of the product being packaged and produces a high thermal insulating value with virtually no air infiltration."
